# Sample functions
Create three functions.
1. A function that multiplies all of it's arguments together, use star parameters.
1. A function that takes in a number, and returns two numbers that add to that number.
1. A function that calls the spliter function, and then the multiplier function, and returns the results.

Call each of the functions and print the results.

Example output:

> multi(2, 3, 4) = 24

> split(24) = 2, 22

> combined(24) = 44
