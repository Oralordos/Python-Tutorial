# Code packages

Create a Python package with at least three modules. The package itself counts as a module.

* The package root should have a function for saying hello and a function for saying goodbye to a user.
* One of the modules should have at least three math related functions.
* One of the modules should have at least two string related functions.

Each module should run its functions when it is main, and print the results. When it is imported, it should be silent.

After the package is made, activate setuptools develop mode or install the package,
and write a main package which uses at least one function from each module.
